Please note that I do not expand older projects with newly learned skills, but - if useful - make a new project out of it. I hope you enjoy my work !",

On behalf of everyone, I would like to refer to the 'Odin project' (https://www.theodinproject.com/), which I can highly recommend for all beginners, but also for more experienced web developers. In the area of ​​CSS, I would like to recommend all web content by Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/kepowob), whose videos and courses have helped me a lot.

I completed an apprenticeship as a bricklayer/formwork builder and completed it with distinction. After 6 years I switched to the Austrian Trade Union Confederation to realize my socio-political interests and to do something good for those people who often cannot do it themselves and are politically underrepresented. As a trade unionist, I have been able to accumulate several years of management experience, numerous training courses, skills and abilities in the areas of rhetoric, group dynamics, personnel management, event management, budget policy, business and economics, political economy, etc. Since 2021 I have been filling all my free time with courses and my own further education in the field of web development. Since then I've been gripped by the 'developer'-fever and I'm totally into challenging problems and there creative solutions.",

In addition, it is responsive and you can also play it on mobile devices! All this required a very extensive examination of numerous front-end development topics.

Due to the significantly smaller number of game options, it was a very good preparation for the '4-in-a-row' project, of which it is the little sister.
